# heart-disease-prediction
Heart disease is a very commonly occurring disease in todayâ€™s world. Here I wanted to present a machine learning model which can produce a better accuracy with classifying the people that are prone to heart diseases.So, to achieve the proposed system I am attempting to demonstrate different Machine Learning classification models like decision tree, random forest, KNN, SVM algorithms and state the best model.
